        <p>You're the cat's meow!
My prime article</p>

        <p>Muriel - I am sick until I see you
You sway me as you please
You are the knees of bees</p>

        <p>Muriel - I desperately beseech you
You're almost thirty-three
I've just turned seventeen</p>

        <p>Muriel I'm certain I can please you
I could wash the sheets
After we've done the deed</p>

        <p>Muriel - I'm happy to be secret
You could shame the stars
I dream of you for hours</p>

        <p>Muriel - it's obvious you need me
Halfway through your degree
Denim dungarees</p>

        <p>Sophisticated woman of no equal
I tried to list out all of your flaws
It only made things worse</p>

        <p>Read books to expand my mind
They shrank my universe
My magical ideations 
Never seemed to disperse</p>

        <p>I've filled up every journal
With unrequited verse
Because…</p>

        <p>I'd drop all of my friends fo you
Without any remorse
I'd monitor your parking space
To watch how you reverse</p>

        <p>You know just how to hit me 
Exactly where it hurts
So I written you this album
Where every track just works
You know…</p>

        <p>Muriel
Muriel
You've always been
Such a distraction for me
Aren't you curious</p>

        <p>Muriel
If we could be
Come on and make me happy</p>

        <p>Muriel
Muriel
I'll cause a scene
Such a distraction for me
Aren't you curious</p>

        <p>Muriel
Don't be so mean
I know I'll make you happy</p>
