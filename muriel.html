My prime article
Muriel - I am sick until I see you
You sway me as you please
You are the knees of bees
Muriel - I desperately beseech you
You're almost thirty-three
I've just turned seventeen
Muriel I'm certain I can please you
I could wash the sheets
After we've done the deed
Muriel - I'm happy to be secret
You could shame the stars
I dream of you for hours
Muriel - it's obvious you need me
Halfway through your degree
Denim dungarees
Sophisticated woman of no equal
I tried to list out all of your flaws
It only made things worse
Read books to expand my mind
They shrank my universe
My magical ideations 
Never seemed to disperse
I've filled up every journal
With unrequited verse
Because…
I'd drop all of my friends fo you
Without any remorse
I'd monitor your parking space
To watch how you reverse
You know just how to hit me 
Exactly where it hurts
So I written you this album
Where every track just works
You know…
Muriel
Muriel
You've always been
Such a distraction for me
Aren't you curious
Muriel
If we could be
Come on and make me happy
Muriel
Muriel
I'll cause a scene
Such a distraction for me
Aren't you curious
Muriel
Don't be so mean
I know I'll make you happy</div>
