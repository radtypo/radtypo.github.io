404: Song Not Found (But Still Emitting CO₂)
An essay about music streaming, solar panels, and what happens when you actually try to build a meaningful alternative.

How I Got Here
I landed on Forgotify—a site that surfaces songs on Spotify that have never been played—and clicked on one. That moment gave it its first and possibly only stream: mine.

Spotify now hosts over 100 million tracks, and around 20 million of them have never been played. That track I played? One of them. Each of these unheard tracks still consumes server space, cooling water, and electricity.

I've released music across platforms—MySpace, YouTube, Spotify—tracking streams, optimizing metadata, and chasing listener stats. The economics are stark: artists typically earn £0.003 per stream, meaning 1,000 plays ≈ £3. Spotify now withholds royalties on tracks with fewer than 1,000 streams per year, meaning most artists earn nothing at all.

The Invisible Weight of Streaming
Data centres globally consume 240–340 TWh/year, comparable to the UK's total electricity use, and account for 2–4 % of global CO₂ emissions. In Ireland, data centres already consume 18 % of national electricity, projected to hit 28 % by 2031.

Water is another hidden cost. Cooling a single gigabyte of data can use up to 200 litres of water. Streaming a 50 MB song = ~0.5 litres.

"The planet pays nearly 10 times more to deliver your song than the artist earns from it."
My Stream Calculations
Financial Metric	Value per Stream	Explanation
Gross Payout	0.02p – 0.04p	Paid by platform
After Distributor Cut	~0.017p – 0.034p	10–15% cut
After Label Cut	~0.0025p – 0.017p	50–85% cut
Artist Receives	~0.01p (avg)	Final share
Environmental Metric	Per Stream	Estimated Cost
Energy	~0.0045 kWh	~0.09p (at £0.19/kWh)
Emissions	~2 g CO₂	~0.02p (at £100/tonne CO₂)
Water Use	~0.5 L	~0.0005p (at £1/1,000 L)
Total Impact	—	~0.11p
Building Something Different
You’re reading this article on a solar-powered server built on a £25 Raspberry Pi, powered by a £50 solar panel, and backed by a £25 battery. It holds 64 tracks and supports up to 25 listeners. When the sun shines, it works. When it doesn't, it doesn't.

This setup carries a footprint—panel, battery, transformer—but these are mostly one-off costs. With scale, solar infrastructure could support bigger streaming farms or parts of the traditional stack.

Solar Server Stream Calculations
Environmental Metric	Per Stream	Estimated Cost
Energy	~0.000175 kWh	~£0.000033
Emissions	~0 g CO₂	£0.00
Water Use	~0 L	£0.00
Total Impact	—	~£0.000033
Compared to a traditional stream (0.11p), the solar server reduces environmental impact by ~99%.
